# This is the Foodies API with Strapi

## Before all

```
- Please, contact the author to provide you the ".env" file.
- Please, contact the author to provide you the database file.
- You will need PostgreSQL for this database. You can download it here: https://www.postgresql.org/download/
- After installation, start the Postgres server. Make sure you remember the Postgres port, username, and password (from the ".env" file) because we will use them in connecting Strapi to the Postgres.
- Create a database in PostgreSQL, name it "foodies-db".
- Right click on the database "foodies-db" and click in "Restore". 
- Format "Custom". Click on "Filename" to choose the backup file. (If you don't see the file, click on Format: "All files").
- Select the backup file provided, and then click on "Select".
- Finally, click on "Restore".
- Add the ".env" file in the root directory of the Strapi project. It will make all the connections work.

Note: The media files were configured to be uploaded in Cloudinary. This project has the integration and configuration ready!

Then, a fast start of the whole project is:
- Open the Strapi project in one window of VSCode and run the commands "npm install" and then "npm run develop". It will install the dependencies and then start Strapi server on localhost:1337
- Open a new window of VSCode with the React App project, and run the commands "npm install" and then "npm start". It will install the dependencies and then start the React App on localhost:3000.
```
